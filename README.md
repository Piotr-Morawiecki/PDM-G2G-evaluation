# Evaluation of PDM and G2G rainfall-runoff models
Scripts used to evaluate PDM model (R. Lamb, 1999) and Grid-to-Grid model (V. Bell, 2007)

## About the repository

This GitHub repository includes scripts, which were used in two-part paper "Asymptotic analysis and validation of conceptual rainfall-runoff models" by P. Morawiecki and P.H. Trinh [1,2] for comparing Probability Distributed Model (PDM) implementation by R. Lamb [3] and Grid-to-Grid (G2G) model [4] to the 1D physical benchmark model developed by us in [5].

The repository includes MODELS/ directory with MatLAB implementations of PDM, G2G and 1D physical benchmark model, all applied for a simple 1D benchmark geometry representing a single hillslope. The scripts in the main directory recreate figures from papers [1,2]. The visual appearance of the figures is different than in paper, since for the published version the output data were illustrated using LaTeX TikZ library.

## Repository content

The repository includes the following directories:

* DATA - directory for output data generated by the scripts
* FIGURES - directory for storing output figures
* MODELS - directory with implementations of PDM, G2G and 1D physical benchmark model

The main directory includes the following scripts:
